# Supply Chain: Blockchain

<h3><b>Blockchain Prototype for a Semi-Private Supply Chain</b></h3>
<h4>Rastreability and Traceability of Medicines</h4>
<h5><small>Created by Mauro Cardoso using ( Python, Flask and Ganache), Â©2022</small></h5>

Flask frontend application created for a healthcare supply chain, using the concepts of blockchain technology
<br><br>
<strong>This chain simulates the transactions between actors (Hard-coded) with their respective amounts.
<br> The Ganache application -- U need to install it and configure -- (Rapid Ethereum distribuited application development) works as a Private Ethereum Network, that handles the actors wallets, blocks and transactions.</strong><br>
<strong>These transactions create a hash for each of the data involved in the transaction.</strong><br>
<strong>Each transactions generates the details with all the logs acting as the ledger.</strong><br><br>
<strong>Smart contracts are built in a simple layout in the solidity language (Needs better work), with hard-coded details.</strong><br><br>
This network is supposed to be semi-private so the spaces below, simulate the spaces reserved for each participant,<br> 
being this number reduced there is a faster consensus and a higher transaction transfer rate and greater scalability.<br> 
If there is a change in interactions it can be easy discovered through the Ganache application, or business needs, only the admin can access and modify with ease.
<br>
There is an obstacle in this implementation as it does not have a logic of permissions applied to the actors in the network and it has no structured process applied, acting only as a simulation of interaction between interfaces with the shell of a blockchain network.<br><br>
The management of a B2B or enterprise network like this is managed by a Administrator in Ganache application.
